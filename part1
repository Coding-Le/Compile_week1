First, you need to download jflex-1.4.3.zip and set up your environment.
To set up JFlex, you can use one of the following methods:
first method:
将 jflex-1.4.3 放到某个目录, 编辑 jflex-1.4.3\bin\jflex.bat:将其中的 JFLEX_HOME 和 JAVA_HOME 设置为自己系统相对应的路径
set JFLEX_HOME=C:\jflex-1.4.3
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Java\jdk1.7.0
在环境变量 PATH 中添加 jflex 的路径:
PATH=C:\jflex-1.4.3\bin
second method:
if you don't care the path, you can input 'sudo apt-get install jflex' into your terminal, it is ok.


Second, you can use one of the two methods to set up Cup:
method 1:
将 java-cup-11a.jar 解压缩,然后将其中的 java-cup 放到 C:\jflex-1.4.3\examples\cup下
method 2:
将 java-cup-11a.jar 配置到环境变量中,在 CLASSPATH 后添加该 jar 包的路径:
CLASSPATH=.;%JAVA_HOME%\lib\tools.jar;%JAVA_HOME%\lib\dt.jar;D:\Study\Comp
ilersPrinciples\Software\java-cup-11a.jar


Third, you can use JFlex and Cup to do some easy test:
To compile, you can input the following command into your terminal:
cd /home/le/Desktop/compiler/2/jflex-1.4.3/examples/cup  //change to adapt your path
jflex lcalc.flex
java java_cup.Main < ycalc.cup
javac Main.java

To run, you can input the following command into your terminal:
java Main test.txt

After doing these things, your will see the figure:

/home/le/Pictures/Screenshot from 2015-09-25 09:37:10.png

which means that you have done this job.




there are many files in the folder, the follwing are some descriptions for them:
Main.java       demo of a main program
Makefile        makefile to compile and test the example
README          this file
lcalc.flex      the lexer spec
output.good     how the output should look like for the test
ycalc.cup       the parser spec
test.txt        sample input for testing
